<h1>MALAGASY BOXING OR MORENGY</h1>
<h2>description:</h2>
<P>On feast days and some weekends, you can attend a môrengy in the afternoon, and then when night falls<br>
go dancing and have fun at night club.<br>
    Môrengy is a combat sport and a Malagasy martial art<br>
    Môrengy is comparable to Thai boxing: two men take turns fighting each other with bare hands.<br>
 Hand-to-hand combat is forbidden, but kicking and kneeing are allowed.<br>
If the historical period and the context in which it was created are debated <br>
 we know with certainty that it was born in the Sakalava region, and more precisely in the northwest of the Big Island.<br>
  It has since spread widely throughout the country.<br>
 Although the sport can be played in sports centres such as<br>
  gyms, the Malagasy prefer its original version, in the open air and on the ground<br>
  Nowadays, the môrengy is a tradition to which the Sakalava are deeply attached.<br>
  Taking place in the afternoon, it is also a public entertainment, which makes the joy of the youngest as well as the oldest.
  <br> All people can attend.They take part in the “show” by encouraging the opponents with joyful shouts>.<br></P>
