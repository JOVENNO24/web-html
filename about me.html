        <h2>My Life Story</h2>
        <p>I have been working as a tour guide since 2021. During a rainy season, I guided many tourists, striving to ensure their satisfaction. One memorable moment was when a client asked me why I became a tour guide. I shared my journey, expressing my passion for learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With the support of a generous individual and their team, I started my journey into programming, building my first website in 2024.</p>
