    <h1>LOKO BE NATIONAL PARK</h1>
    <h2>description:</h2>
    <p>As you fly into Nosy Be, you won't just be struck by the glorious sight of turquoise waters and scattered
        islands, but also some heartening patches of dark green forest. In Nosy Be Island itself, this forest is the
        Lokobe National Park, which is a 7.4km2 preserve Madagascar's most easterly tropical rainforest. 
        
        Nosy Be has Madagascar it's best infrastructure, so it is hardly surprising that most of its forest has been
        converted to farm land, coastal dwellings and towns, of which the interestingly named Hellville is its
        capital. The forests of Lokobe would have gone the same way, but were saved when in 1926, they were
        gazetted as a Strict Nature Reserve. Scientists and researchers were the only people granted access;
        until in 2011 when the area was pronounced a national park. 
        
        Nowadays we can access the park from the sea, via a small village called Ampasipohy. The local
        community takes great pride in the forest and we hire local guides who are expert at finding Lokobe's
        abundant life.
